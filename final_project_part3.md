# Part III - Final Data Story

## Final Modifications

After getting the insights from user interviews during Part II, I decided to use the US general public as the target audience of my final data story as all the users I interviewed agreed that this story would be related and informative to the general public. In order to be persuasive and informative to the general public, who is the target I chose, I need to make the audience engaged with the story using data. Therefore, I made some edits on my high-fidelity prototype based on the 4 key action items I planned in part II. 

Firstly, I revised the elders physically attacked chart since it was the point that all the users found confusing during the interviews. I added the color to the chart title to make it clearer, revised the labels of the chart, and changed the font size of the labels.

Secondly, I added some photos to improve the aesthetics of the stories and better evoke emotions. I chose to use dark-themed photos at the start and the statistics showing the violence situation, while using the brighter-colored photos that have positive meaning towards the end, which is the call-to-action section to convey hope and encourage the #StopAsianHate actions.

Thirdly, I made the call-to-action part more concrete by breaking it down into three action items with succinct and easy-to-understand sentences. I added links to external resources to accommodate the audience in case they are interested in learning more about the actions they can take. Also, I included the direct link to organizations and fundraising campaigns supporting the #StopAsianHate issue to trigger immediate actions after they finish reading the page.

Finally, I edited the narratives of the story by mentioning the #StopAsianHate at the beginning and the end of the story to make it more cohesive and reiterate the main purpose of the story.

## Summary

In summary, I started the project by identifying the target audience and the purpose of the project and the actions I wanted my audience to take after they read the webpage. The identified target audience and the goals made it easier for me to develop the story arc and the overall mood of the story. Then, I developed the initial sketches of the data I wanted to show on the page. The next step was to create a prototype and conduct user interviews to gain insights on how to further improve the storytelling and the data visualizations. I found the user interview step very helpful because the users provided me different perspectives and pointed out the issues that I had not noticed before. Finally, I incorporated the comments and made final changes to the project page. The challenging part for me in this project is to find the data to visualize. The violence on Asian Americans is a recent issue, so it is difficult to find a big and reliable dataset from government websites. 

There are several key takeaways that I learned from this course. 

1. The story progression planning is very important in creating a persuasive story. 

Prior to taking this course, I did not usually plan the story progression in my presentations. Instead, I put all the information down without much thought. Creating the storyboard made the story more smooth and engaging, and it provided a sense check tool that I could quickly review and show to others to get the feedback. 

2. The audience preferred data visualizations that are simple and easy to understand. 

During the sketching and the prototyping processes, I created a few versions of the same chart and asked users for their feedback. Although some versions of the sketches provided more comprehensive information, they sometimes distracted the audience from the key messages of the chart. Moreover, the too complicated chart required a long time to comprehend, which made the user feel less engaged from the story and the mood that we created during the earlier part of the story.

3. Colors are effective in conveying the mood and create cohesiveness to the story. 

I utilized the course concept of the moodboard to pick a color theme for my final project. As the story I picked was dramatic, shocking, and sad, I picked black and white photos for the most part of my project, and transitioned to more colorful photos towards the end where I planned the more positive mood for my audience. I also used the same color accents for my narratives and visualizations. The colors were helpful in making the story smooth and cohesive. It turned out that the color theme worked very well and I received compliments from the users during the interview and a classmate during the project presentation.

Overall, the final project was a great way to get my hands dirty with a real topic I am interested in, as well as an excellent opportunity to try the steps in story development and data visualization that I learned in class.
