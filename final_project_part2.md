# Final Project: #StopAsianHate
# Part II: Final project wireframes / storyboards and user research

In this part, I focused on obtaining insights and feedback from user research. The initial feedback from users in part 1 was very useful as I learned a lot viewing my project from other perspectives. I divided this part into 4 major steps including 1) developing project wireframes to get a higher-fidelity testable prototype 2) preparing for user interviews 3) conducting user interviews 4) synthesizing the feedback and 5) preparing for the next steps

## Step 1: Developing project wireframes

Since I created detailed sketches and crafted a storyline during part I of the project, it was easier to continue building on them in part II. I decided to further develop all the sketches into a prototype using Shorthand, the actual tool that I will use for my final presentation. As my project has a lot of emotional elements in it, I found it more efficient to build a very high fidelity prototype that includes photos, videos, texts, and actual data visualizations that I plan to incorporate into the final project so that I can test them all with the users and obtain user feedback.

The link to the prototype is included here: https://preview.shorthand.com/zsnnzITqr9IOgY5j

## Step 2: Preparing for user interviews

First, I need to identify the appropriate individuals who would be great representatives of the actual audience, or could potentially provide insightful feedback to the visualizations.

Since my project is mainly about anti-Asian Americans hate crimes, there are three main types of a person whom I would like to interview:
An Asian American who is well aware of the problem and wants to spread awareness of the issue. I want to see if this goes well with their goals, and if they have any suggestions on how I can improve the persuasiveness of the visualizations.
A non-Asian American who might not be familiar with the problem, so that I can learn how effective this visualization is to people who are not aware of this problem.
A classmate in the Telling Stories with Data course who might be able to provide insightful comments on my data visualizations

After identifying the individuals, I prepared the user interview questions and scripts. I planned to begin the interview by briefly introducing myself and the purpose of the interview. Then, go through the questions. I came up with a set of open-ended questions to let the users explain their thoughts as much as they can, and I planned to ask follow-up questions to get further details from their answers. The interview script and the questions list are included in the next section.

## Step 3: Conducting user interviews

I was able to interview 3 individuals as listed below:

Person 1: An Asian student who is in the “Telling stories with Data” course. This person is familiar with my project and the topic as they gave feedback on my Part I before.
Person 2: A non-Asian who is not familiar with my project, and has a little knowledge about the issue.
Person 3: An Asian-American who has not seen my project before, but is familiar with the Asian-American hate crimes issue.


**Interview Script**

Introduction: 

“Thank you for your time participating in the user interview today. The goal of this interview is to get feedback from you on my data visualization project, see what goes well and what’s confusing, or how might I improve the storytelling and the visualization. The interview will take around 15-20 minutes.”

“Next, I’ll show you the webpage. Since it is designed to stand on its own without my narrative, I’ll just let you read but feel free to talk aloud your thoughts or comments anytime if you have one. After you finish the page, I’ll ask you a set of questions.”

Questions:

“First of all, can you give me a brief introduction about yourself and how familiar you are with the violence against Asian-Americans”
“Who do you think is the main audience for this web page?”
“What do you think is the main purpose of this page?”
“How effective or successful do you think this page is in achieving the main purpose in the previous question to the main audience group?”
“Which section do you find the most interesting or engaging? and why?”
“Which section do you think is the most confusing or not the most effective? and why?”
“What would you do differently to make that section better?”
“Are there any other thoughts or comments that you would like to share that I haven’t asked?”

Closing: “Thank you very much for your time!”

## Step 4: Synthesizing the user feedback

The answers to the questions are listed below:

**“Who do you think is the main audience for this web page?”**

All of the users provided very similar answers. They mentioned the general public within the US as the main audience. Person 3 further mentioned the younger population because the medium of this is a web page, and that they are more engaged with the recent social movement on racial issues.

Their answers are satisfactory as the US general public is my main target audience.

**“What do you think is the main purpose of this page?”**

They were all able to identify my main purposes of this project, which is to raise awareness to the Anti-Asian hate crimes issues, to empathize with the victims, and to stop this problem.

“How effective or successful do you think this page is in achieving the main purpose in the previous question to the main audience group?”

Person 1: “It is very effective. The web page talked about the problem in a very tangible way. The videos at the top did a great job setting the emotions. The visualizations help support the narratives and make them very solid.”
 
Person 2: “It is effective. It stirs up the feelings, while telling how important and how serious the problem is.”

Person 3: “The web page is very informative. For the persuasiveness, I felt like it’s almost there. The photos and the videos bring a lot of emotions, but I feel that more photos towards the end, and a solid call-to-action will make it even more persuasive.

**“Which section do you find the most interesting or engaging? and why?”**

All of them liked the opening video. Person 1 said they were really moved by the cases summary section and the narrative below it that a hate crime might be happening to someone at this moment. Person 2 also loved the cases summary, saying that it was alarming to see a lot of cases in February alone, combined with the section below it, which talked about the fact that above cases were only the cases reported to the police and there might be other cases unreported. Person 3 loved the use of the photos, especially the grandma and the photo in the last section.

“Which section do you think is the most confusing or not the most effective? and why?”
All of them were confused by the bar chart visualizing the proportion of elders being physically assaulted. They all said that it took them some time to understand it. When I further asked them to explain their understanding of the visualization, they interpreted the chart in different ways, which is not my intention.

**“What would you do differently to make that section better?”**

They provided me with a lot of recommendations to improve the bar chart. Person 1 suggested that I change the chart title and the labels, also the narratives above and below the chart. Person 2 suggested that I add a line to that chart indicating that the second bar is the subset of the first bar. Person 3 suggested that I use different shades of yellow and change the chart labels.

**“Are there any other thoughts or comments that you would like to share?”**

Person 1: “I really like the color choice of the overall page. The dark theme goes well with the overall mood of the story. However, I feel a little disconnection between the covid cases and the hate crimes and I need to scroll down to finally understand the linkage between the two.”

Person 2: “I liked the color choice. The white and yellow on the black make it easy to read.”

Person 3: “The section showing the COVID cases looked quite bland, you can try adding some photos to make it look more interesting. Also, I saw you used #StopAsianHate as a topic but I didn’t see that again until the end. Adding the hashtag throughout the webpage will make it more cohesive and persuasive.”


During the interview, the users mentioned that they could not really comment on the call-to-action section as it was not very detailed. However, I mentioned my plan to break down the call to action into 3 pages and they all liked the idea.
Also, Person 2 and 3, who are English native speakers, helped suggest some better phrases for my narratives and corrected some grammatical errors. All the comments are very helpful to me.

## Step 5: Preparing for the next steps

After getting the feedback, I made some minor changes along the way between the interviews. However, I listed some major change plans as follows:

- Revise the chart of the elders being attacked by changing the labels, the colors, the title, and exploring the tool to add some lines indicating that the second bar is the subset of the first bar.
- Add more photos into the pandemic section, making it look more interesting and dramatic.
- Break down and elaborate the call-to-action items and add some supporting details, visualizations, or photos to further persuade the readers.
- Mention the #StopAsianHate again in the call-to-action section to encourage the readers to spread awareness of the issue.
