# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

In this assignment, I selected an interesting visualization on Enrollment in HBCU data, critiqued it, and tried to build a redesign of the visualization.

The original visualization is included below.

The original chart visualizes the trend in Public and Private HBCU enrollment as well as the proportion of female students using galaxy-themed chart grids. I found this chart interesting to redesign as the original chart creator took a creative approach to visualizing it. I would like to try simpler visualization methods using the concepts we learned in class and see how much we can improve the readability of it.

I began the redesign process by critiquing the original chart using the heuristic model provided in class. I looked at this visualization from different perspectives and found that the chart type and the colors were the main points that I would like to change in the redesign to make the chart clearer to the audience. Therefore, I created four different versions of sketches using different chart types and colors, and discussed them with two of my classmates. The four sketches are as follows:

1. A set of stacked column chart visualizing a trend in public and private enrollment, with a line chart showing the percentage of female students.
2. 2 separated stacked column charts. One showing a trend in public and private enrollment, the other showing the trend in the proportion of male and female students. The two charts are in different color themes.
3. 2 separated charts. One is a stacked column chart showing a trend in public and private enrollment, the other is an area chart showing a percentage of female students. The two charts are in different color themes.
4. 2 sets of stacked column charts showing together the proportion of male in private HBCU, male in public HBCU, female in public HBCU, and female in private HBCU

The two classmates provided similar feedback to my sketches. They both preferred the first sketch. They commented that it gave a clear and complete picture of the data, and they did not find a need to separate the messages into two charts as in sketch #2 and #3. 
Looking at sketch #1, they were able to explain the main message of the chart and identified the target audience of the chart without confusion. Conversely, each of them translated sketch #4 in a different way, and they found it confusing that I used two shades of pink and blue. One of them also commented that sketch #4 would look very messy and crowded when I use it to visualize the whole dataset that includes almost 40 years of data, which was the point that Iâ€™d never thought of prior to the discussion. They also provided other useful comments such as comments on colors, chart title, etc. that I incorporated into my final visualization.

I think that testing the sketches with other people is very helpful. The process provided new perspectives to my prototype, and helped me answer the questions that I was not clear about. For example, prior to the discussion, I was worried that having two Y-axes would make sketch #1 confusing to the audience and I assumed that they would prefer sketch #2 and #3 over sketch #1. However, talking to them disproved my assumption as the audience did not think that sketch #1 was confusing at all, and they liked it the most among the four sketches.

Therefore, I went on with the design in the first sketch. However, when I input the real data, I found that the message was clearer if I chose the grouped column chart instead of the stacked column chart I used in the sketch. The grouped column chart makes it easier to compare within public and private HBCU enrollment among the years, and it was easier to recognize the declining trend of public HBCU enrollment in the more recent years. In terms of colors, I utilized the tools mentioned in class (https://coolors.co/) to pick a visually appealing color theme and ensure that people with colorblindness would be able to explore my chart without confusion.

**Below is my final redesigned visualization.**
