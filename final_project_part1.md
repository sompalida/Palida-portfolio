# Final Project: #StopAsianHate

## An outline
In the final project, I plan to visualize hate crime data on Asians in the US. There have been rising incidents, especially against the senior population, since the covid-19 pandemic. The recent incident in San Francisco resulted in the death of an 84-year-old Thai man. There were also a lot of other hate crimes in other areas in the US. I would like to bring this issue into awareness of people outside the Asian and Asian-American community. I started developing the story by thinking from the reader’s perspective.

“As a reader, I want to understand and be aware of the problems that are happening in the society I’m a part of, so that we can end this problem. I can do this by taking action and speaking out when I see inappropriate behaviors. Moreover, I can stand as an ally and provide support to the victims.”

With this goal in mind, I plan to point out the rise in the recent hate crimes, starting by showing a few video footages of hate violence against Asians to generate strong emotions for the audience, then broaden it to visualize the rising crimes against the Asian population compared to people of other ethnicities since the covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, I plan to explore the data to find out if the violence against the Asian is just the recent trend, or is it a systemic problem that has been continued for a long time. Lastly, I will introduce the goal of this project, which is to bring this issue into the limelight, and trigger the audience to take action to help end this problem. I will use a success story of the #BlackLivesMatter movement to inspire the audience that if we are aware of the problem and speak out, the problem will be uncovered and that our voices can generate a big social movement to the mass. 

The sketch of the story arc is as included below:

## Initial sketches


## The data
The primary data source of this project will be the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/downloads-and-docs). The source contains data on hate crime incidents including the victim and the offender data, locations, bias motivation, etc.
Additional source I will look into is the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/race-aian.html) on race/ethnicity data and geographical distribution in the US.
Also, because I plan to use Black Lives Matter trend as an example of a successful social movement against racism, and lead the audience to the call-to-action part. I will also incorporate [Google trends data](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=US) and [Twitter trends data](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/10/blacklivesmatter-surges-on-twitter-after-george-floyds-death/) on the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag in my story.
I might also include the [COVID-19 daily cases data](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-daily-cases-deaths-and-hospitalizations) to visualize the rise of hate crimes against Asians even though the covid cases declined.

## Method and medium
I plan on using Shorthand as a tool to build the story. I might use Tableau, Flourish, and Datawrapper to create the visualizations. 

For the final project presentation, I would like to walk the audience through the shorthand stories. Beginning with embedding the short video of the January incident, and walk the audience through the visualizations and the call-to-action section as detailed in the outline and sketches sections above.
