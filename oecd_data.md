Although the three charts above visualize the same dataset, the key takeaways that the audience get from them are very different. The first chart gives a snapshot of Debt-to-GDP ratios of OECD countries in 2018. By looking at the chart, the audience gets an overview of what the ratios look like in 2018, and see the ranking from countries with the lowest to the highest ratios. 

In contrast, Chart 2 focuses more on the trends, and trend comparison between the countries. With the grid of line chart, viewers can choose either to see the trend of an individual country they are interested in, or compare among countries. We can see that there are many countries whose ratios are more stable, and there are those whose ratio changed dramatically over time.

In Chart 3, I wanted to highlight the growth of Japanese government's debt-to-GDP ratio compared to other countries. I chose Bar Chart Race to highlight Japan's rise from having the 4th largest to the largest ratio among all countries. Although the comparison between countries are visualized in Chart 2, the bar chart race makes it much easier to compare the data of each year among the countries. However, the Bar Chart Race only focuses on the countries with higest ratios, so viewers do not get to know any data for countries with lower ratios.
